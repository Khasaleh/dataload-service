# .env.example
# This file serves as a template for the environment variables required by the application.
# For local development, copy this file to .env and replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.
# For production/staging environments, these variables should be set directly in the environment
# (e.g., via Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets, Docker environment variables, etc.).
# Do NOT commit your actual .env file containing secrets to version control.

# --- Wasabi S3 Configuration ---
WASABI_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.your-wasabi-region.wasabisys.com
WASABI_ACCESS_KEY=your_wasabi_access_key
WASABI_SECRET_KEY=your_wasabi_secret_key
WASABI_BUCKET_NAME=your_upload_bucket_name

# --- Database Configuration ---
DB_DRIVER=postgresql+psycopg2
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_db_name

# Optional: Schema names if used consistently across environments
# These are used as defaults if not overridden by more specific logic (e.g., per-tenant schemas)
CATALOG_SERVICE_SCHEMA=catalog
BUSINESS_SERVICE_SCHEMA=business

# --- JWT Authentication Configuration ---
# Generate a strong, random secret for production.
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_minimum_32_characters_long
# Default algorithm used for JWT signing (HS512 recommended for better security than HS256).
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS512
# Lifetime of the access token in minutes.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# --- Redis Configuration (Application Tasks & Caching) ---
# Common Redis server connection details.
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Database number for application-specific ID mapping (used by tasks in load_jobs.py).
# It's good practice to use separate Redis DBs for different purposes.
REDIS_DB_ID_MAPPING=1

# TTL for session-related keys in Redis (e.g., ID maps for an upload session), in seconds.
REDIS_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS=86400 # Default: 24 hours

# --- Celery Configuration (Redis Backend/Broker) ---
# These Celery settings typically reuse REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT if Celery shares the same Redis instance.
# Ensure these are distinct from REDIS_DB_ID_MAPPING if possible, or manage keys carefully.

# Database number for Celery message broker (where tasks are sent).
CELERY_BROKER_DB_NUMBER=0
# Database number for Celery result backend (where task results are stored).
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND_DB_NUMBER=0

# --- Caching (Example - Configure in your caching library if used) ---
# If you use Redis for general application caching (e.g., for API responses or computed data),
# configure your caching library to use a separate Redis database number to keep data isolated.
# This helps prevent key collisions and allows for independent data management (e.g., flushing cache DB).
# CACHING_REDIS_DB_NUMBER=2 # Example: DB 2 for caching

# --- General Application Settings (Example) ---
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# FastAPI specific, e.g. for live reload in dev
# RELOAD=true
