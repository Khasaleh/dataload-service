    Root GraphQL Mutation type.

    Currently, no mutations are defined as token generation and file upload
    are handled by other mechanisms (e.g., external auth, REST API).

    # If there are no mutations, this class can be empty:
    pass

# If the Mutation class is empty and no mutations are intended for this GraphQL schema,
# the `mutation=Mutation` argument can be omitted when creating `strawberry.Schema` in `main.py`.
# For example: `schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)`
# This change would also be made in `app/main.py`.
# For now, keeping the empty Mutation class for explicitness.
